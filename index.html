							With the recent increase in popularity that NCR saw this November, I thought it might be hard for some members of the Neos community to clearly visualize just how much money they now have on their hands.<br>
							To clear up some confusions around this, I decided to make this page, showing people examples of what they could buy from their new-found fortunes.<br>
							And all of it, presented without any confusing graphs, high numbers or weird crypto-words that no one really, truly understands.

						<p>
							It's simple:<br>
							Type how much NCR you own into the text field at the top and hit enter.<br>
							Shortly after, the left side of this page will fill up with helpful examples, showing you just how many things you could buy from that! (together with links to places you can buy them from)

							This page was made possible by the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api">CoingGecko API</a>.<br>
							Which states that I should mention them here and is also really easy to use. Thanks, CoinGecko, for enabling my stupid jokes!
